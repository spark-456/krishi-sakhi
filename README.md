# 🌾 Krishi Sakhi — *Farmer's Friend*

> An AI-powered Agricultural Decision Support Platform for smallholder farmers in India.

---

## The Problem

India's agricultural extension worker-to-farmer ratio has fallen below **1 : 5,000**. Smallholder farmers make high-stakes decisions on crop selection, pest management, irrigation, and market timing **without any structured expert guidance**. Public extension services require travel and time most farmers simply cannot afford.

**Krishi Sakhi** fills that gap — a single AI-assisted interface, operable on low-end smartphones under intermittent connectivity.

## What It Does

| Capability | How |
|---|---|
| 🗣️ Conversational advisory | Ask questions in text or voice; get grounded, RAG-backed answers |
| 🌱 Crop recommendations | Soil NPK + weather inputs → ranked crop list from a Random Forest model |
| 🪲 Pest / disease detection | Upload a photo → YOLOv8n classifies soil type or pest |
| 📈 Price forecasting | Prophet time-series model gives 7–14 day directional mandi signals |
| 🌦️ Live weather context | Open-Meteo integrated into every advisory query automatically |
| 🔒 Safety guardrails | Never gives pesticide dosages, financial guarantees, or medical advice |

## Request Flow (single advisory turn)

```
Farmer input (text / voice / image)
    │
    ├─ Voice  → Whisper microservice → transcribed text (audio discarded)
    ├─ Image  → YOLOv8n / pest model → class + confidence appended to context
    └─ Text   → enters pipeline directly
    │
    ▼
FastAPI assembles context block:
    farmers (name, district, language)
    + farms (area, soil_type, irrigation)
    + crop_records (active crop, growth stage)
    + expense_logs (last 30 days, by category)
    + Open-Meteo (live weather)
    + ML output (if image was sent)
    │
    ▼
POST to Dify Chat API
    Dify: FAISS metadata-filtered search → Cloud LLM generation
    Safety guardrail evaluation
    │
    ▼
FastAPI writes advisory_messages (full audit record)
    │

Response returned to PWA → displayed to farmer

## Database Overview

19 ordered migrations create the full schema. Core tables:

- **`farmers`** — profile, language, location (RLS: own row only)
- **`farms`** — land parcels with soil/irrigation info
- **`crop_records`** — active/past crops per farm (one active per farm enforced)
- **`expense_logs`** — categorised farm expenses
- **`advisory_sessions` + `advisory_messages`** — full immutable audit trail of every AI interaction
- **`soil_scans` / `pest_scans`** — ML outputs + S3 image paths (permanent, used for retraining)
- **`crop_recommendation_requests` / `price_forecast_requests`** — ML query logs
- **`ref_crops` / `ref_locations` / `ref_knowledge_documents`** — read-only reference tables

> **RLS is enabled on every table.** Farmers can only access their own rows. ML output tables are service-role-insert-only.

---

## Safety Guardrails

The Dify agent **will never**:
- Provide specific pesticide dosages or chemical formulations
- Make financial predictions or guarantee market prices
- Provide medical advice (humans or animals)
- Answer queries outside the agricultural domain

All unsafe queries are deferred to the nearest **Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK)** and the deferral is logged (`advisory_messages.was_deferred_to_kvk = true`).

---

## Data Privacy

- 🔇 **Voice audio is never stored** — Whisper processes in memory and discards immediately
- 🔒 **All storage buckets** enforce farmer-scoped path RLS (`path LIKE auth.uid() || '%'`)
- 🚫 **Service role key** is never used in application code — migrations and admin tooling only

---

## 🚀 Future Ideas

### More ML Models

| Idea | Model Approach | Value |
|---|---|---|
| **Irrigation scheduler** | LSTM on weather + soil moisture time-series | Tell farmers exactly when and how much to irrigate |
| **Yield predictor** | XGBoost on historical crop_records + weather | Pre-harvest yield estimates to plan storage / selling |
| **Pest outbreak early warning** | Anomaly detection on aggregated `pest_scans` across a district | Community-level alerts before an outbreak spreads |
| **Fertiliser optimiser** | Multi-objective optimisation on NPK + soil + crop | Minimise input cost, maximise yield — crop-specific dosing |
| **Credit risk scoring** | Gradient Boosting on expense/yield history | Help farmers access microloans using their own farm data as proof |
| **Multilingual NLP** | Fine-tuned IndicBERT / MuRIL | Native Tamil / Telugu query understanding without translation step |
| **Plant health from leaf images** | EfficientNet disease classifier | Expand beyond pest detection to nutrient deficiency, fungal disease |

### 🕸️ Farmer Community Graph *(Experimental)*

> The core idea: smallholder farmers are isolated. Individually, they have **no negotiating power**. Collectively — growing the same crop, in the same region, at the same time — they could sell together, buy inputs together, and share real-world knowledge. A graph makes those invisible connections visible.

**How it could work:**

```
Every farmer is a node. Edges form when farmers share:

  ┌─────────┐          ┌─────────┐
  │ Farmer A│──crop────│ Farmer B│   (both growing paddy, Kharif)
  └────┬────┘          └────┬────┘
       │                    │
     district             tools
       │                    │
  ┌────▼────┐          ┌────▼────┐
  │ Farmer C│──region──│ Farmer D│   (same block, soil type)
  └─────────┘          └─────────┘
```

**Edge types (similarity dimensions):**
- **Same crop + same season** → collective selling / input procurement group
- **Same district + same crop** → local mandi price intelligence sharing
- **Same soil type + same irrigation** → relevant advisory cross-pollination
- **Similar farm size + similar expense patterns** → peer comparison and benchmarking

**What it unlocks:**
- 🤝 **Collective bargaining** — "6 farmers in your block are also harvesting tomatoes this week. Form a group to negotiate with traders."
- 📦 **Bulk input buying** — pool orders for seeds/fertiliser to get wholesale rates
- 🧠 **Peer knowledge** — "A farmer 12 km from you with the same soil type tried drip irrigation. Here's what happened."
- 📊 **Crowdsourced mandi intelligence** — real sale prices reported by farmers in your network, not just official data
- 🚨 **Outbreak propagation alerts** — pest report in one node triggers early warnings for connected nodes

**Tech approach (exploratory):**
- Graph stored in **Neo4j** or **PostgreSQL with pgvector + recursive CTEs**
- Similarity computed from existing `farmers`, `farms`, `crop_records` data — no extra farmer input needed
- Community detection (Louvain algorithm) to surface natural farmer clusters
- Graph edges weighted and decayed over time (a connection via an old crop is weaker than a current one)
- PWA surfaces this as a **"Farmers near you growing the same crop"** feed — opt-in, privacy-preserving

> ⚠️ *This is an experimental concept. Privacy, trust, and user consent design would need to come first before any implementation. Farmers must opt in explicitly.*

## Current Status

> Research prototype — evaluated, **not yet in field trial**

Known gaps: multilingual UI (Tamil/Telugu planned), RAG context recall at 65% (semantic chunking improvement path identified), no real farmer cohort data yet.

## 🌍 A Note to End On

Krishi Sakhi started with one question: *what if every farmer had a knowledgeable friend they could call, any time, in their own language, for free?*

We're not there yet — but the foundation is real, the models work, and the data pipeline is live. Every soil photo a farmer uploads makes the classifier smarter. Every advisory turn logged makes the RAG system more auditable. Every edge we draw in a farmer graph brings isolated growers a little closer together.

The problems are hard. The farmers are resilient. The technology is ready to help.

**There's a lot of road ahead — and we're excited to walk it. 🌱**
